# AN-E-COUPON-SERVICE-BASED-ON-BLOCKCHAIN

The contemporary surge in e-commerce has underscored the significance of electronic coupons (e-coupons) as a pivotal marketing tool. However, the prevalent centralized management of e-coupon systems poses substantial security challenges, making them susceptible to fraudulent activities and data manipulation. In response to this, our project introduces a groundbreaking e-coupon service based on blockchain technology and the HMAC Digital Signature Algorithm.

## Problem Statement:

The increasing reliance on electronic coupons necessitates a robust and secure system to manage their distribution and utilization. Existing centralized systems are vulnerable to data tampering and fraudulent activities, leading to substantial financial losses. Our project addresses this issue by proposing a decentralized e-coupon service leveraging blockchain, smart contracts, and advanced cryptographic techniques to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access and manipulations.

## Methodology

Our proposed system introduces a novel approach to e-coupon management, utilizing blockchain technology and the HMAC Digital Signature Algorithm to fortify security. The system employs smart contracts for key operations, including e-coupon issuance, downloading, gifting, and purchasing, ensuring the integrity of transactions. The incorporation of a malicious block-avoiding contract further strengthens the system's resilience against potential threats. In conclusion, our system provides an innovative and secure framework for managing e-coupons, contributing to the evolution of secure and efficient e-commerce practices.
